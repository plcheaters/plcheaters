## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Just a guy who drinks coffee, writes code, and keeps pushing boundaries.

At 15, I've already picked up **Python, JavaScript, C#, Lua, and C++**—especially thriving in Python, JS, and Windows Forms apps. My biggest project so far? [**Aurora**](https://github.com/plcheaters/aurora): a website hub for website lists, built for the [plcheaters](https://github.com/plcheaters) community.

Winner of **Coder of the Year** at DMC Coding, I'm always learning and building. You can find all my links at [guns.lol/kappaalul](https://guns.lol/kappaalul).

## 🎨 What Makes Me Tick

- **Code**: From scripts to full-stack apps, I love the challenge of solving new problems.
- **Coffee**: My best ideas are brewed alongside a steaming mug ☕.
- **Curiosity**: I dive into tech because I want to know *how* and *why* everything works.
